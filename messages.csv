Let me give you a bit more context about us, too. So, the way Wanted works is that you, as a talent, just set your salary. Companies will reach out blind via Wanted only based on locations, skills & min. salary.  That is when you (as a talent) will know about the company. You will get a page with all the details (committed salary of course but also perks, equity, project, team, etc…)  Then, only if you accept to reveal your profile, they will know more about you (like who you are). If you don’t like the offer, your profile keeps being anonymous. This way, we keep everyone anonymous until there is a salary+skill match, and the talent accepts the company request.  Does it make sense? That is why we will need to know your salary request first (can be something like your current + 15-25%) to check if there is a match etc. Let me know your thoughts!",INBOX
